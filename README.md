# Background
The world experienced three "waves" of democracies in recent history: the rise of suffrage from 1828–1926, the collapse of autocratic regimes from the end of World War II, and finally the third wave being the fall of communism. These "trends" showed a continual rise in democracies, which eventually peaked until a new phenomenon occurred. However, the third wave has caused two unique situations to occur. One is that the new democratic institutions are undergoing a constant cycle of autocratizing, and the other is that long-established democracies are also doing the same. In 2010, the world was at its peak for global counties democratizing. This is no longer the case. Democratic backsliding is the process where a state progressively becomes more autocratic, where, among other values, rulers are no longer responsive to citizens, elections are not competitive, suffrage is not extensive, civil liberties are not protected, and there are no checks and balances.

# Purpose
The view that democracy, once attained in a wealthy, stable, and developed country, would remain so, is no longer the case. Some "third wave" democracies are now stronger than long-established democracies. The argument, then, is that the cresting and ebbing of the waves does not explain why there is this new wave of autocratization. Therefore, the Varieties of Democracy Institute created the V-Dem Project, which monitors the development of democracy across the globe. Indicators of democracy are measured in different ways, according to this measurement, but the midpoint being used is the "liberal democracy index", which also takes into account the "electoral democracy index". The goal, then, is to create a user-focused Shiny app where the users can navigate the V-Dem dataset and see the significant influencers against it, both on a country-level and through the years.

# Business Applications
The problem is that the impossible has become possible. A wildcard, the "unexpected trend", can happen to any business and it is important to be able to not only identify the factors, but also create visual representations for it. One needs to be prepared for everything, and when you have graphs that hint towards the possibilities of future trends, or suggested just how strong an unexpected influencer could be, then you can be better prepared for said influencers. It is hoped that this type of app could directly be translate to any type of business going through a certain trend during a certain time period. Simply replace "country" with "company", and replace the variables with whatever you think the influencers are. This is further enforced by the "background" influencers being examined in the main study, such as the GINI coefficient. 

# Future Works
Right from the beginning, the "target" can be changed, or even enhanced, by looking at the other indices. "Liberal democracy" was chosen arbitrarily, merely because it was most associated with a Western outlook on rule of law. Another issue is that V-Dem actually goes back to the 1700's when it comes to electoral democracy as an index. The 1980's were chosen because it coincided with the GINI coefficient from the United Nations Statistics Division (also the focus was more on the recent democratic backsliding in the past decade). It should also be noted that the V-Dem database isn't actually one "database", in fact, it is four. While what was used was a combined version of the Party database and the "Full+Others", perhaps "Country-Date" or the "V-Dem Core" would have simplified the data. 

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, machine learning could be used to potentially predict future "hot spots" or dangers across the world in relation to democratic backsliding. This is taking into account that the main blamed reasons are polarization, populism, anti-pluralism, and wealth inequality. The reason this factor is mentioned is because the concerning "trend" is occurring more frequently in the past few years than anywhere else, and the ideal would be to identify how to stop it.
